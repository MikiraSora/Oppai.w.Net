## Oppai.w.Net (Oppai.wrapper.Net ~~,not owo~~)
---

This is a oppai wrapper library for use easily.It contains all of oppai raw api function and more useful wrapper class , so you needn't reimplment pp algorithm in other languages/frameworks.
<br><br>
This library just a P/Invoke wrapper , you have to build/copy your oppai.dll to folder what you use.and **oppai.dll must be x86 and version must >= 3.0**.
<br> If there is any new deprecated/modified api in new version oppai and I will try to reimplement these apis for compatible use.
